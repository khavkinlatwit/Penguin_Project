# Penguin Report
##### By: Leo Khavkin


## Introduction
  

The project was undertaken to investigate several key questions regarding the physical attributes of penguins in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. Firstly, the researchers sought to determine if there exists a correlation between the body mass and flipper length of the penguins within the dataset. Secondly, they aimed to ascertain whether a significant difference in body mass exists between the Adélie species and the chinstrap species of penguins. Lastly, the researchers endeavored to explore the correlation between flipper length and flipper depth among the penguins. Utilizing the comprehensive dataset available, the study aimed to provide insights into these specific relationships, contributing to a deeper understanding of penguin biology and ecology in the Antarctic region.


## Selection of Data

 The Palmer Archipelago, nestled within the frigid embrace of Antarctica, serves as a critical habitat for various species, including penguins. Studying these resilient inhabitants provides invaluable insights into the delicate ecosystems of the region and the broader impacts of climate change. The Palmer Archipelago Antarctica Penguin Dataset, available on Kaggle, encapsulates comprehensive data on penguin populations within this pristine environment. This dataset offers researchers, environmentalists, and enthusiasts a unique opportunity to delve into the lives, behaviors, and ecological dynamics of three penguin species: Adélie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo. With detailed measurements, observations, and metadata, this dataset serves as a cornerstone for diverse analyses, ranging from population trends and habitat preferences to the effects of environmental factors on these iconic Antarctic residents. Whether exploring patterns of migration, reproductive success rates, or anthropogenic impacts, the Palmer Archipelago Antarctica Penguin Dataset presents a rich tapestry of information, fostering deeper understanding and informed conservation efforts for these charismatic creatures and their fragile home.

## Methods

In addressing the research questions, the project utilized various materials and tools within Jupyter environment. These included essential libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, seaborn for data visualization, matplotlib.pyplot for creating plots, numpy for numerical computations, and scipy.stats for statistical analysis. However, before delving into analysis, it was imperative to preprocess the data due to the presence of null entries. Cleaning the data involved identifying and handling missing values appropriately to ensure the integrity and accuracy of subsequent analyses and findings.
